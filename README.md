# Lips: Fast, Lightweight Reactive UI Framework

Lips is a modern, runtime-based UI framework that brings fine-grained reactivity without the need for build steps. Create dynamic web applications with a simple, declarative syntax that feels familiar to HTML developers while providing powerful reactive capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Zero Build Step**: Just import the script and start building
- **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Only updates what changed, not the entire component
- **Intuitive Template Syntax**: Simple yet powerful templating that's familiar to HTML developers
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions for better developer experience
- **Built-in Performance Monitoring**: Track rendering performance with integrated benchmarking
- **Flexible Component Architecture**: Object-based or ES Module syntax for your components
- **Context API**: Share state across components without prop drilling
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Fine-grained control over component behavior
- **Built-in Routing & i18n**: Everything you need in a single package
